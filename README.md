# First Floor Flooding
An interactive tool for exploring flood risk in Galveston, TX. Use the dropdown menus to toggle between flooding scenarios (i.e., Hurricane Ike hitting in 2050 with intermediate sea level rise). Built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).

Originally developed for the [NOAA Sea Grant](https://seagrant.noaa.gov/) program alongside [Galveston Historical Foundation](http://www.galvestonhistory.org/) and [Marine Weather & Climate](https://www.marineweatherandclimate.com/).

## Running locally
If you're comfortable on the command line, navigate to the project folder and run the Python development server.
```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
or
```
$ python3 -m http.server
```
The map should be accessible from your browser at `localhost:8000`.

Alternatively, the [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) text editor makes it easy to preview web apps while you work. After installing Brackets (and Chrome), open up the project folder with Brackets and click on the little lightning bolt. :zap:
