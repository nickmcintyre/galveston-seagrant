# First Floor Flooding
An interactive tool for exploring flood risk in Galveston, TX. Use the dropdown menus to toggle between flooding scenarios (i.e., Hurricane Ike hitting in 2050 with intermediate sea level rise). Built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).

Originally developed for the [NOAA Sea Grant](https://seagrant.noaa.gov/) program alongside [Galveston Historical Foundation](http://www.galvestonhistory.org/) and [Marine Weather & Climate](https://www.marineweatherandclimate.com/).
